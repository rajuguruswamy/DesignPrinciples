<body>
The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) states that clients should not be forced to depend
on interfaces they do not use. In other words, it suggests that you should design fine-grained
interfaces that are specific to the needs of the clients.

Consider a scenario where you are designing an interface for a document editing application.
You want to create an interface that allows different types of users to perform various actions.
The application has two types of users: basic users and advanced users. Basic users can create, edit,
and save documents,while advanced users can perform all actions, including printing documents.

If we implement the DocumentEditor interface violates the Interface Segregation Principle because it forces
the BasicUser class to implement the printDocument() method, which is not relevant to basic users.
To adhere to the Interface Segregation Principle, you should create smaller, more specific interfaces:
