It states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.
Instead, both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details;
details should depend on abstractions.

<h3>High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules:</h3>
Traditionally, high-level modules (e.g., business logic, user interface) directly depend on low-level modules
(e.g., database access, file system operations). This creates tight coupling, making the system rigid
and difficult to change.

<h3>Both should depend on abstractions:</h3>
Instead of high-level modules depending directly on low-level modules, both should depend on abstractions.
Abstractions represent contracts or interfaces that define how high-level and low-level modules interact.
This allows for flexibility and interchangeability of implementations.

<h3>Abstractions should not depend on details:</h3>
Abstractions should define the behavior or contract without depending on specific implementation details.
This allows for multiple implementations to fulfill the same contract, promoting flexibility and extensibility.

<h3>Details should depend on abstractions:</h3>
Low-level modules, which contain the implementation details, should depend on the abstractions defined
by high-level modules. This allows for multiple implementations of low-level functionality to fulfill
the same contract, without affecting the high-level modules.
